# STRICH SDK Angular sample code

This repository shows to integrate STRICH SDK in an Angular project.

You need a valid license key to run this sample. To get started with STRICH SDK, check out to the [Getting Started](https://strich.io/getting-started.html) guide.

_Note: this sample uses environment files to store environment-specific license keys. Starting with 15, these files are no longer automatically generated at project creation time.
By popular demand, Angular 15.1 and upwards now offer creating those files with a CLI command, see:
